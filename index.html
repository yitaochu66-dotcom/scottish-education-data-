            <h1>Silent Voices: Language and Power in Scottish Education</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A Data Story from 1888 to 1962</p>
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>Between 1888 and 1962, thousands of Scottish children sat for their Leaving Certificate examinations. Behind these exam papers lies a story about language, power, and whose voices were heard in the classroom. This webpage explores historical exam records to reveal how English dominated the education system while Gaelic - the indigenous language of Scotland - remained nearly invisible. It also shows how war disrupted learning and how later policy changes attempted to reshape education.</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>The Dataset</h2>
            <p>This analysis draws on a collection of Scottish education documents spanning 74 years, from 1888 to 1962. The dataset includes exam papers, policy circulars, and education regulations - a total of 269 official documents that offer a window into Scotland's educational past.</p>

            <p>Through these documents, we ask two central questions:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>How are different language subjects represented in the exam system, and what does this tell us about linguistic power?</li>
                <li>How did war and educational policy changes affect the examination system over time?</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="languages">
            <h2>Section 1: Languages in the Exam System</h2>
            
            <h3>The Dominance of English</h3>
            <p>When we examine which language subjects appear most frequently in the examination records, a clear hierarchy emerges. <span class="emphasis">English stands far above all other languages</span>, with 303 recorded documents across the 74-year period. This is not simply a matter of educational preference - it reflects a deeper structure of power in Scottish education.</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <img src="language_subjects_chart.png" alt="Language Subjects Frequency Chart">
                <p class="chart-caption">Language subjects in Scottish leaving certificate examinations (1888-1962). English dominates while Gaelic remains marginal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>What this data suggests</h4>
                <p>To obtain a leaving certificate, students typically needed to demonstrate proficiency in English. Other European languages like French, Latin, and German also featured prominently in the curriculum. However, Gaelic - the indigenous language of Scotland - appears with far less frequency, despite its historical and cultural significance to Scottish identity.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Silence of Gaelic</h3>
            <p>Gaelic has been spoken in Scotland for over 1,500 years. Yet in the examination system that determined children's educational futures, Gaelic was treated as marginal. The data shows 235 Gaelic-related records across all years - less than English alone. This disparity is not accidental. It represents a systematic privileging of English over Scotland's indigenous language.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>The examination system required English for certification, effectively silencing native Gaelic speakers and limiting children's ability to learn and express themselves in their mother tongue.</p>
                <span class="source">Historical Education Records Analysis</span>
            </div>

            <p>For children who grew up speaking Gaelic at home, this created a profound challenge. To succeed in school meant adopting English - the language of power, administration, and opportunity. This linguistic pressure may have constrained children's creativity and cultural expression, forcing them into a narrow model of what counted as legitimate knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Other Languages: French, Latin, German</h3>
            <p>Beyond English and Gaelic, the examination system valued classical and modern European languages. French, Latin, and German all featured regularly in the curriculum. These were languages of empire, classical learning, and continental Europe - languages that connected Scotland to broader networks of power and culture, but that also reinforced social hierarchies, as they were typically taught in higher-class schools.</p>

        <section id="war">
            <h2>Section 2: War and the Interruption of Learning</h2>
            
            <h3>The Impact of Conflict</h3>
            <p>Education does not exist in a vacuum. When we trace the number of education documents produced each year, we see clear evidence of how historical events - particularly war - disrupted the normal functioning of schools and examinations.</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <img src="timeline_chart.png" alt="Document Timeline Chart">
                <p class="chart-caption">Number of education documents per year (1888-1962). Note the sharp drops during both world wars, with zero records in 1944-1945.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>What this data suggests</h4>
                <p>During the years of the Second World War (1939-1945), the number of exam and policy documents falls dramatically. In 1944 and 1945, there are <span class="highlight">no documents at all</span> in our dataset. This absence speaks volumes: when society is consumed by war, normal education systems cannot function as usual.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This disruption had real consequences for children. Many young people who should have been taking exams during these years had their education interrupted or curtailed entirely. Teachers were called to military service, school buildings were requisitioned, and the focus of national attention shifted from education to survival and warfare.</p>

            <h3>The Long Shadow of War</h3>
            <p>The effects of war extended beyond the immediate conflict years. Even after 1945, it took time for the education system to recover and for examination records to return to pre-war levels. The gap in the data represents more than just missing paperwork - it represents <span class="emphasis">lost opportunities for a generation of young people</span> whose schooling was forever marked by the experience of war.</p>

        <section id="policy">
            <h2>Section 3: Changing Rules and the Education Act</h2>
            
            <h3>A Moment of Reform</h3>
            <p>In 1918, Scotland passed a major Education Act that changed the rules governing schooling and certification. This legislation came in the aftermath of the First World War, at a moment when society was rethinking many of its institutions. The Act raised the school leaving age, expanded access to secondary education, and reformed the examination system.</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <img src="language_trends_chart.png" alt="Language Trends Over Time">
                <p class="chart-caption">Language subject trends over time. The 1918 Education Act (marked by vertical line) represents a policy shift, though English continues to dominate.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Hope and Continuity</h3>
            <p>The 1918 Education Act represented a small opening for hope - a recognition that education needed to be more accessible and more equitable. In the decades following the Act, we can see some changes in the pattern of subjects taught and examined. There were modest increases in the diversity of subjects, including some attention to vocational and practical skills alongside traditional academic subjects.</p>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>What this data suggests</h4>
                <p>However, the fundamental structure of linguistic power remained largely unchanged. English continued its dominance. Gaelic remained marginal. The Act improved access to education, but it did not fundamentally challenge whose language, whose culture, and whose knowledge counted as legitimate in the examination system.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This pattern reminds us that policy reform alone cannot undo deep-seated structures of power. Real change requires not just new laws, but a reimagining of what education is for and whose voices should be heard within it.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion: What the Data Tells Us</h2>
            
            <p>When we look at 74 years of Scottish examination records, we see more than just numbers and documents. We see a story about language, power, and children's futures.</p>

            <h3>Four Key Findings</h3>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>1. The Dominance of English:</strong> English was not just one language among many - it was the language of success, required for certification and advancement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>2. The Silence of Gaelic:</strong> Despite its deep roots in Scottish culture and history, Gaelic was treated as marginal in the education system, reflecting broader patterns of linguistic suppression.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>3. War's Disruption:</strong> The data reveals stark gaps during wartime, particularly 1944-1945, showing how conflict interrupts the education of entire generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>4. The Limits of Reform:</strong> The 1918 Education Act brought some positive changes, but fundamental structures of linguistic power persisted well into the mid-20th century.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Beyond Test Scores</h3>
            <p>This analysis demonstrates that examination data can tell us much more than how well students performed on tests. It can reveal <span class="emphasis">whose knowledge counted, whose language mattered, and whose children had the opportunity to succeed</span>. By reading these historical records critically, we can better understand the structures of power that shaped education in the past - and that continue to shape it today.</p>

            <p>The story of Scottish education between 1888 and 1962 is ultimately a story about voices - which ones were heard, which were silenced, and which struggled to be recognized. As we reflect on this history, we might ask: whose voices are being silenced in our current education systems, and what can we do to ensure that all children have the opportunity to learn and express themselves in their own language and culture?</p>
